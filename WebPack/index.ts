    -   This is the entry point for the WebPack build.  It is the first file that is loaded
    by WebPack.  
    -   It is responsible for loading the main application file and any polyfills that 
    are required.

    This is an entirely optional topic. You don't have to know how to use Webpack to be a 
    TypeScript developer.
    You can use TypeScript in all sorts of situations where you may or may not use Webpack.

// first we must go to the tsconfig and set the module to "esnext" and the target to "es5", "es6" or "es2015"

// then we must install webpack, webpack-cli, webpack-dev-server, typescript,  ts-loader, html-webpack-plugin, clean-webpack-plugin, webpack-merge, and webpack-bundle-analyzer as dev dependencies (a lot)
// npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server typescript ts-loader html-webpack-plugin clean-webpack-plugin webpack-merge webpack-bundle-analyzer --save-dev
// install typescript is not necessary because it is already installed, but it is a good practice to install it as a dev dependency

// then we must go to the package.json and add the following scripts:
// "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js",
// "start": "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.config.js --open",
// "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"

// Then we must CREATE a webpack.config.js file in the root directory
// There are a model of this file it in this folder

// run npm run build
// the bundle.js file will be created in the dist folder
// Now we can link the bundle.js file in the index.html file and the application will work as expected!!!!

// run: npm run start to start the webpack-dev-server and see the application running in the browser =)

                                        Adding Sorce Maps

    -   Source maps are a way of mapping the code in the bundle back to the original source
    code.  This is useful for debugging purposes.  If you have a problem in your code, you
    can see the original source code in the browser's debugger.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

// In tsconfig.json we must uncomment the line: "sourceMap": true,
// Also, we must go to the webpack.common.js file and add the following line:
// devtool: 'inline-source-map',

// then we must run npm run build again
// now we can see the original source code in the browser's debugger
// et voil√† =)

                                        WebPack Dev Server

    -   The WebPack Dev Server is a development server that provides live reloading.  It
    also provides a web server that hosts the application.
    -   It is not intended for production use. It is only intended for development, keeping
    the build process fast and efficient. Maintaining the bundle in memory and serving it
    from memory is much faster than writing it to disk and serving it from disk.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

// In webpack.common.js we must add the following line:
// devServer: {
//     contentBase: './dist'
// },
// we should add add development mode in the webpack.common.js file
// mode: 'development',

// then we must run npm run start
// now we can see the application running in the browser

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    WebPack Production Build

    -   The WebPack production build is a build that is intended for production use.  It
    is slower than the development build, but it is optimized for production use.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

// In webpack.common.js and copy the content of the file to webpack.prod.js
// In webpack.prod.js we must add the following line:
// mode: 'production',

// in package.json we must add the following line:
// "build": "webpack --config webpack.prod.js",

// then we must run npm run build
// now we can see the application running in the browser

// [contenthash] is a hash of the content of the file.  It is used to ensure that the
// browser doesn't use a cached version of the file.  If the file changes, the hash will
// change, and the browser will load the new version of the file.
// [contenthash].bundle.js is the name of the bundle file.  It is a good practice to
// include the hash in the file name so that the browser doesn't use a cached version of
// the file.

// We can add this lovely plugin to help to clean the dist folder before each build
// and we must add the following plugins:
// plugins: [
// new CleanWebpackPlugin(['dist']),
// new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
//     title: 'Production'
// }),
// new UglifyJsPlugin({
//     sourceMap: true
// }),
// new OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin({}),
// and we must add the following line:
// optimization: {
//     minimizer: [
//         new UglifyJsPlugin({
//             cache: true,
//             parallel: true,
//             sourceMap: true // set to true if you want JS source maps
//         }),
//         new OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin({})
//     ]

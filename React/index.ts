// You could use React without TypeScript, and it is recommended.
// One way to use React with TypeScript is to use the create-react-app tool.  This tool
// creates a React application with TypeScript support.  It also creates a development
// server and a production build.
//
// To start new Create React App project, we must run the following command:
// npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
//
// Then we must go to the react-typescript folder and run the application:
// npm start

// We can also create a React App in Vite. Vite is a build tool for modern web projects.
// It is a build tool for modern web projects.  It is a build tool for modern web projects.
// To start new Vite project, we must run the following command:
// npm init @vitejs/app react-typescript --template react-ts

// Then we must go to the react-typescript folder and run the application:
// npm run dev

// Now we can see the application running in the browser =)

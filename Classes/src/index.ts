                                           TypeScript Classes

    -   Classes in TypeScript are similar to classes in other languages like Java or C#.
    -   TypeScript supports new features in JavaScript, like support for class-based object-oriented 
        programming.
    -   Classes in TypeScript support inheritance, constructors, getters/setters, and static members.
    -   Classes are in fact "special functions", and just as you can define functions, you can also define 
        classes.
    -   Classes are a way to create objects with pre-defined properties and methods.
    -   Classes encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
    -   Classes are a way to define a custom type.
